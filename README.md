### Notes
I ran into trouble with getting familiar with XCode, specifically the location of important tools, and showing the gif on GitHub. I watched YouTube videos and read articles from various websites to help me with getting familiar with the locations. I made sure the gif was in the approriate folder, looked up how to insert img tag, and implemented it on the README.
