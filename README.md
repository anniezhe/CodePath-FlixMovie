### Notes
While building the app, Apple released a new version of Xcode. My laptop went ahead and began the upgrade process. I had to wait until my laptop was finished with installing, which took a few hours.

### Notes
I ran into trouble with getting familiar with XCode, specifically the location of important tools, and showing the gif on GitHub. I watched YouTube videos and read articles from various websites to help me with getting familiar with the locations. I made sure the gif was in the approriate folder, looked up how to insert img tag, and implemented it on the README.
